# Introduction

**The demo is based on the [angular2-seed](https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed) project and my [blog post "Dynamically Configuring the Angular's Router"](http://blog.mgechev.com/2015/12/30/angular2-router-dynamic-route-config-definition-creation/).**

In order to run it use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mgechev/dynamic-route-creator
cd dynamic-route-creator
npm install
npm start
```
